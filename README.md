# Ehlers-Homodyne-Discriminator-Python

What the fudge is a Homodyne Discriminator ????
Well.... basically, in electrical engineering, homodyne detection is a method of extracting information encoded as modulation of the phase and/or frequency of an 
oscillating signal, by comparing that signal with a standard oscillation that would be identical to the signal if it carried null information.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr........... yeah all it does is detect and get encoded variations of a signals sent from a carrier wave to suppress noise and maybe make the information
that the carrier wave holds much more understandable.
 
 A Homodyne Discriminator detects the homodyne signal and compares it against a not null signal.
 
 How does this help? I'm not an engineer you say.....
 
 Well young padiwan, we interact with signals everyday but for this case we're going to be looking at the Homodyne Discriminator in the financial markets.
 
 Ever heard a trader talk? It's a whole other language talking about breakouts and resistance and hammer heads....WHAT????? And you know what? there is no proven way
 to predict the market other than information(you know... the stuff you shouldn't know).
 
 Talking about information, and knowing, seriously take my word for it, that you CANNOT predict the market based off technical analysis... where can we get this information?
 Answer, the price is the information(open,close,high,low) but not the way you think. We know that if the price is going down...uhmmm...its going down same with going up
 generally.By that logic just follow the price.
 
 Moshi moshi!!!!!!!! What in the befuddling heavens are you talking about?
 Shhhhhhhhh......... I'm getting there.Prices are just signals(open at a particular time and close at a particular time and fluctuate within that time) i.e discrete signals.
 Which is why indicators like your Relative Strength Index are possible, the problem here is that these prices/signals are actually reflective of a mass populations emotions
 and honestly some of ya'll are all over the place.
 
 We just need to remove that noise and then follow the price/signal that we want to.
 
 The formula used is in John F. Ehlers book ROCKET SCIENCE FOR TRADERS(READ IT!!!!!).
 
 We take a signal(not telling you) just know it shows depth of fear or rather the sum of a 1001 heartbreaks(promise its still open,close,low,high) and discriminate that.
 Now there is a clear noiseless signal to simply follow, this system can be teaked and applyed to anything of course.
  
 DO NOT TAKE THIS ALGO AS IS....TEST IT... MODIFY IT... AND ONLY USE YOUR LUCH MONEY TO TRADE.
 
 The usable file is the 'third_test_case.py' the others just show my process to getting there.
